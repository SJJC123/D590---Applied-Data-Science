# Final Project D590 Applied Data Science
**Team Members: Sergio Carrillo, Babita Kurmi, Daniel Bronfeyn**

The Interactive Job Market Insights Web Application was designed to provide a data-driven platform that assists job seekers, employers, career coaches, and market researchers in making informed decisions about career choices, talent acquisition, and labor market trends. The application aims to address the growing need for insights into job trends, salary distributions, skill requirements, and industry-specific data.

For job seekers, the app offers a way to explore potential career paths, evaluate salary expectations, and find relevant job opportunities. Employers benefit from understanding talent trends, while career coaches can use the platform to guide clients more effectively. Researchers gain access to comprehensive data analysis to explore employment trends and identify patterns within specific sectors.

This final portion of the project combines all previously completed work (exploratory data analysis, machine learning models, etc.) and turns the visualizations we've created and information we've discovered into an interactive web application. With this tool, anyone can get job/career suggestions that display information like salaries, work type, and location to gain ideas on which jobs would best fit their preferences. This web application provides a simple, easy-to-use platform that connects data-driven insights with practical decision-making, helping users explore opportunities and make choices that match their goals.
